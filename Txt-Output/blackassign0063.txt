imagine speak comprehend you. captivity, place breathe. finally selected place, happy moment you. finally freedom sadly free, prodded rods fed toxic substances will. thing scream vain. voice heard lost noise scientific advancement. writhe pain substances effect body, pain slowly creeps body slowly succumb it, wake again. time aristotle, animals subjected inhumane experiments sake knowledge. experiments unethical advancement science. animal testing important part experimenting living organisms ensure product safe humans consume. lab animals generally subjected high levels toxicity isolation due suffer lot stress discomfort. animal testing large number drawbacks: animals human beings react differently substances. example, 2004, vioxx withdrew “rofexocib” 80,000 people suffered heart attacks taking drug. drug showed effects animal testing, posed threat human beings. costly conduct animal testing animals provided shelter food large period trials completed. animal testing lead scientific breakthrough. instances animal testing failing achieve desired result ultimately leads loss time, resources money. products cosmetics essential humans don’t require animal testing all. cosmetic industry notorious animal testing products it’s pity products aren’t launched market. things make question ourselves. worth it? stop cruelty hampering growth? advancement science, made don’t animals again. advanced computing– availability software programs easier understand working biological organism. replicate entire human body conduct tests generate simulations assess effects chemical biological reaction. example, cadd (computer-aided drug design) popular stimulating drug affects cells not. cuts requirement animals testing reduces experimentation time researchers don’t wait animals show response. tissue culture – growing tissues petri dishes vitro cells viable alternative animal testing. tissues cells brain, liver, kidney etc. animal suitable growth medium weeks year. cultures test toxicity efficacy substances. example: eye irritancy tests, animals experiment check substance irritating eye not. animals permanently lose eyesight animal time simply inhumane. bovine corneal organ culture corneal tissue cultured weeks yields result complications. scientists started method test toxicity efficacy cosmetics, drugs chemical sectors. 3-d printing– making complex tissue structures single digital file astonishing. printing tissues carrying experiments results similar real tissues. earlier animal organs, charts 3-d models explain functioning organ medical students bio-printing companies started making human tissues organs students medical schools understand intricacies human organs helped bringing animal experimentation large extent. bio-printed models researchers conduct experiments animals it. french company working bio-printed liver model test liver toxicity animals all. breakthrough field bio-technology bring animal experimentation large percentage. organ-on-a-chip method – fairly technology consists growing cells inside chips imitate structure behavior human organs. researchers test drugs chips cheaper humane testing animals. example, uk company cn bio system consists 10 organs single chip tissues ranging liver brain.micro dosing: humans participate experiments injected small time doses constantly monitored imaging techniques gather information happening body. tests replace tests animals removing drug compounds don’t desired effect human body. example, covid-19 tests carried human volunteers small doses vaccine constant surveillance. helped researchers removing drugs desired effect human body remove animal testing processes. alternatives bringing animal experimentation large extent. science progress harming animals putting excruciating pain. protect animals living world them. blackcoffer insights 21: eeshan singh sowmya p, icfai business school, hyderabad
